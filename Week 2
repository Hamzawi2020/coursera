Problem:
Some hospitals will get long time to rescue the injury people from severe accidents because of the 
location of the accident. In our project, we aim to predict the severity types of accidents and try 
to provide this information to hospitals to be ready with the ambulances. As a result, that will decrease 
number of the maturity in the country. 
-	We can also use the output of our model to warn the people in the risky regions to be more cautious.  

Stockers:
-	Hospitals. 
-	Citizens who have vehicles.

Data Description:
Output (SEVERITYCODE): Our model predicts the severity of the accident whether there is injury or property damage. 
Input: latitude and longitude (x,y), the date of the accident(INCDATE), whether the human under 
       alcohol or drugs(UNDERINFL), weather (Weather), Round conditions (ROADCOND), Light condition (LIGHTCOND). 

Example:
In the location (-122.32,47.70), there was an accident in 2013/03/27 and the driver was not under the influence 
of the drags and alcohol and the weather was overcast and the road was wet and that happened in daylight.
 All the previous information will be the input of our data. While the output of the model will be 2 which
 denotes to injuries.
